title: Use short sentences
intro-text: Try to limit each sentence to one subject and verb when possible.

You can break up long sentences in several ways, including using bulleted lists. You can also start a sentence with a conjunction (and, or, but), especially when you want to emphasize the information that follows the conjunction.
